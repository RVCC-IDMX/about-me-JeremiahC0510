# About Me

My name: Jeremiah Curtis

Netlify Badge: Successful

The purpose of this project was originally created to help me learn the ins and outs of what creating a simple and well-designed website for my personal portfolio would be like. During this project I learned a lot of different things when it comes to HTML code and css design. I found out about linking throughout code and the correct way to insert and use media files in my own personal design. Besides that, I learned about the different elements in HTML and how to use element selectors to relate my css to my HTML. The other major thing I learned which I was able to tweak a lot to my specific wants and needs was syntax of different properties. Finally, when it comes to editing my website the three things that became very apparent to me was editing my website so that it automatically resizes at different pixel amounts, using flexbox to help orientate objects of my website to certain areas of my website and most importantly grids which I found a lot easier to use from my own personal understanding of them. Without learning any of these skills mentioned I would not have been able to develop my website the way it is.

When it comes to color schemes at first, I had a bunch of different bright colors like red, orange, and yellow for background colors with a dark blue or black for the color of my words. I didnâ€™t end up liking that after a while and I recently changed it in one of my CPRs. Now I have a mint background #00FEB8 with a dark grey #3A3B3D background color on each section. In each section my words are for the most part light blue #00E5FF which I think looks really good especially since it sort of blends with the background color of my avatar, but for my main paragraph I used an off white #DFDFE8 which really helps set that section apart. The last color I used was a dark blue #1B00D0 for the sections that were overlayed on top of my mint background.
