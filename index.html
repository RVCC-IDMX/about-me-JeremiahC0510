            <h2>Background Image Properties</h2>

            <div>

            <p>I’ve learned a lot this semester in Web Page Development and during the midterm I was struggling with a few key features that I now know a lot better today than I did then. One of the problems I was having on the midterm was a simple fix that should have only taken me minutes but instead took me a few hours to where I had to walk away and figure it out the next day. My problem was trying to figure out how to include an image as a background and change the properties to how I would want it specifically. It is a mouthful, but it isn’t supposed to be very hard to do. </p>

            <p>The way I figured out how to do this is by using background-image property which specifies an image to use as the background of an element. The way this property works is by linking an image on your computer to the code via the url or name of the .jpg stored on your computer. What I did was add the image I was trying to use as my background to my img folder that was included in my vscode. After that I used the property in my code’s css with the url of the image I was trying to use as the background. For some reason this was not working, and I tried a bunch of other techniques, but I really wanted to use this property as it was one of the main ones I was finding online from a bunch of other people. In the end I realized I was using a backslash instead of a forward slash. When I found out that this was my problem, I was super relieved because I didn’t think it would be that small of an error I was having. After I got my picture as my background using the background-image: url(/img/cave.jpg) property, I was then able to edit the background image to exactly where I wanted it.</p>

            <p>The way you setup your background when using an image is sort of the same when you are trying to get an image on a specific part of your webpage. Instead of moving the image on top of everything else, you are moving the image behind everything else with a small window of where you can see the image. This can be easily done with positioning properties and height and width properties as well. The main property I used was the background-position property which allows you to line up your picture exactly where you want it depending on the image’s size. Also, if you want you can change the opacity of the image alongside a border and pretty much anything else you can think of. Just know that once you get the origin of your image with the url and make sure it isn’t a repeating image, then you can size it and make sure it is clipping correctly. Remember making a website is sort of like painting a picture where you try different things and see if they work, if not you can go back in and edit it completely different.</p>

            <p>The image used in this section was done using the procedures I talked about in this section. I took this picture of the sky when I was in Poland which was a real adventure!</p>
